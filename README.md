VBA Challenge

Overview of Project

Steve is interested in analyzing green stock data to help his parents pick the right stock or stocks to invest in. Using existing stock data provided, we were tasked with conducting an analysis using VBA macros to see how stocks performed with the hope of uncovering some insights to help Steveâ€™s parents invest wisely.

VBA Code and Challenges 

A code was developed to help determine performance, specifically daily volume and yearly return for several stocks. An initial code was developed to compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018. The code was then refactored to challenge the execution times of the original script. 

Results

The execution times for the refactored script decreased compared to the original. The images below show years 2017 and 2018 execution times before and after the refactoring.

Summary

In general, refactoring code allows for more organized and faster programming. When working with others on a large project, refactoring a code could make it easier to read and allows others to understand it better. Some disadvantages include the amount of time it takes to refactor a code and the risk of causing the script not to run due to a lack of understanding of the code. Regarding the original and refactored script we were tasked to analyze, the advantage we most observed was the decreased macro run-time as seen in the images above.
